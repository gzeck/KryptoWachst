The Problem: 
I want to invest into cryptocurrency but I don't know the best time to buy to maximize my investment and I dont have the time to research market trends.  I am risk averse and dont have the time or the knowledge of the market to best make use of my money but don't want to miss out on investing in an impactful new ecosystem.


The Solution: 
A service that partners with you to identify the best time to buy in on your scheduled payments to maximize your value.  When you tell us how much you would like to invest on a daily/weekly/monthly basis we will analyze historical pricing patterns as well as safeguarding against massive growth patterns as has been the recent trend, to help secure you an effective buy order that will beat the average purchase price had you tried to handle this on your own. 


Why Us?:
We are watching and constantly evolving our approach, using the power of analytics to assess and act upon the pricing patterns that are not readily discernible to the new or experienced investor.  Something like this would take hours or days at a time to research, and you might miss the opportunity you were looking for.  Investing in such a relatively new area such as cryptocurrency requires a steady hand and as much information as you can gather to help protect your actions.  We take care of both of these for you so you can sit back and watch your dollar stretch farther than you could have ever anticipated.


Value Proposition:
We will create a platform that allows for new and experienced users to leverage analytics to improve their chances of having a better ROI in this dynamic and ever evolving crypto space.  In doing so we will support ourselves and the services we provide
