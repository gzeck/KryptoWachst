<pair_name> = pair name
    a = ask array(<price>, <whole lot volume>, <lot volume>),
    b = bid array(<price>, <whole lot volume>, <lot volume>),
    c = last trade closed array(<price>, <lot volume>),
    v = volume array(<today>, <last 24 hours>),
    p = volume weighted average price array(<today>, <last 24 hours>),
    t = number of trades array(<today>, <last 24 hours>),
    l = low array(<today>, <last 24 hours>),
    h = high array(<today>, <last 24 hours>),

since = return committed OHLC data since given id (optional.  exclusive)
Result: array of pair name and OHLC data

<pair_name> = pair name
    array of array entries(<time>, <open>, <high>, <low>, <close>, <vwap>, <volume>, <count>)
last = id to be used as since when polling for new, committed OHLC data
